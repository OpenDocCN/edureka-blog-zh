Profiling is a procedure of pinpointing a bottleneck performance at miniature levels. This mainly includes developers or performance testers and is done by presentation teams for manufacturing . You can profile in any application layer which is getting tested. If you want to do application profiling you may require utilizing tools for performance profiling of application servers.**Q22\. What are the entering & exiting criteria for Performance Testing?**![enter exit criteria - performance testing interview questions - edureka](../Images/a7de94365c7191737fb9e6fc579b9798.png)The starting of the performance testing is done at the design level only. After the testing is done, results are collected and later they are analyzed in order to make improvements regarding the performance. During the whole process of life cycle development, performance tuning is done and the factors on which it is based are scalability and reliability during the presence of the load, application release time and tolerance criteria of performance and stress. **Q23\. What are the activities involved in Performance Testing?**The activities involved in Performance Testing are:

*   需求收集
*   刀具选择
*   性能测试计划
*   性能测试开发
*   性能测试建模

*   报告

**Q24\. What is Stress Testing & Soak Testing?****Stress Testing** – It is a software testing activity that determines the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation. The performance results are analysed to know how far the resources can sustain the upper limit with good performance as expected.**Soak Testing** – Soak Testing is a type of performance test that verifies a system’s stability and performance characteristics over an extended period of time. System resources are monitored with their performances getting affected with load increase.**Q25\. Differentiate between Performance Testing & Performance Engineering**The process of identifying the issues that disturbs the performance of any application is performance testing whereas, improving the performance of the application by observing the measurements got from the performing testing by necessary changes in terms of architecture, resources, implementation etc is performance engineering.**Q26\. How would you identify the performance bottleneck situations?**![performance bottleneck - performance testing interview questions - edureka](../Images/3083d54284dff60fc4cdef3b21c5bdcf.png)Performance Bottlenecks are recognized by monitoring the app against load and stress conditions. To find bottleneck situation in performance testing the testers usually use Load Runner because it supports many different types of monitors like a run-time monitor, network delay monitor, web resource monitor, database server monitor, firewall monitor, ERP server resources monitor and Java performance monitor. These monitors in turn help to the tester to establish the condition which causes an increase in the response time of the application. **Q27\. How to perform Spike Testing in JMeter?**In JMeter, spike testing can be achieved by using Synchronizing Timer. The threads are jammed by synchronizing the timer until a specific number of threads have been successfully blocked, and then release them at once thus creating large immediate load.**Q28\. What are the different components of LoadRunner?**The major components of LoadRunner include:**![LoadRunner - performance testing interview questions - Edureka](../Images/de17825964f126cffa2fa4b1e67fdc33.png)**

*   **VUGen**——记录模拟真实用户动作的 Vuser 脚本。
*   **控制器**——创建、维护和执行负载测试场景的管理中心。
*   **负载生成器**——我们可以通过它生成负载的代理。
*   **分析**–提供总结系统性能的图表和报告

**Q29。什么是相关性？**

Correlation is used to handle the dynamic values in a script. The dynamic values change for each user action when action is replayed by the same user or any different user. In both, the cases correlation takes care of these values and prevents them from failing during execution.**Q30\. Explain the difference between automatic correlation and manual correlation?****Manual Correlation** involves identifying the dynamic value, finding the first occurrence of dynamic value, identifying the unique boundaries of capturing the dynamic value, writing correlation function web_reg_save_param before the request having the first occurrence of dynamic value in its response.**Automated correlation** works on predefined correlation rules. The script is played back and scanned for autocorrelation on failing. Vugen identifies the place wherever the correlation rules work and correlate the value on approval.**Q31\. What is NeoLoad?**![neoload - performance testing interview questions - edureka](../Images/ea2d1816e429c914445e2b2d0c75b9d3.png)Neo load is a type of load testing tool. It measures performance of the web or mobile application. It also provides programmatic solutions to the developers to help them optimize the performance before the application goes into the production. It is available in French and English as well.**Q32\. What is the Modular approach of scripting?**In Modular approach, a function is created for each request such as login, logout, save, delete, etc. This approach gives more freedom to reuse the request and saves time. With this approach, it is recommended to work with web custom request.**Q33\. How are the steps validated in a Script?**Each step in the script is validated with the content on the returned page. A content check verifies whether specific content is present on the web page or not. There are two types of a content check used in LoadRunner:

*   **文本检查**–检查网页上的文本/字符串
*   **图像检查**–检查网页上的图像。

**Q34。如何识别任何应用程序的性能测试用例？**

There are certain measures that you need to consider while monitoring the performance tests. Users have to be working on the core functionality of the application, trying to perform operations on database like CRUD, and the number of users trying to concurrently access the application should be more. With all these criteria, even manual test cases can help you in identifying the performance measurements.**Q35\. What is Correlate graph and overlay graph?****Correlate graph** – The Y-axis of the graphs are plotted against each other. After this, the Y-axis of the graph that is active is considered to be the X-axis of the graph that is merged. Henceforth, the graph that was merged with the Y-axis of that graph becomes the Y-axis merged.![Graph- performance testing interview questions-Edureka](../Images/675a288bc2f04ad75405c74aedbb8268.png)**Overlay graph** – Plot two graphs which contain the same x-axis. Left Y-axis in the merged graph shows the current value of graph. Right Y-axis shows the value of the Y-axis of the graph that was merged.With this, we have come to the end of Performance Testing interview questions article.
